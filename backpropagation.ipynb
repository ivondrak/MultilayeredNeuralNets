    "From the depicted image, it is evident that a neural network is constructed minimally with three layers of neurons: input, output, and at least one internal layer. Always between two neighboring layers, there is what is called full interconnection of neurons, meaning each neuron of a lower layer is connected to all neurons of the higher layer. How is information processed in such a neural network? The example begins with single-pass, therefore feedforward filtering of the signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neurons are first excited to the corresponding level (ranging from 0 to 1) in the output layer.\n",
    "2. This excitation is transferred via connections to the next layer and modified (either amplified or weakened).\n",
    "3. Each neuron in this higher layer sums up the adjusted signals from the lower-layer neurons and is excited to a level determined by its activation function.\n",
    "4. This process propagates through all internal layers until the output layer, where we then obtain the excitation states of all its neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this method, we have obtained a neural response to an input stimulus defined by the excitation of the input-layer neurons. This process of signal propagation occurs similarly in biological systems, where, for instance, the input layer may consist of visual cells, and in the output layer of the brain, specific objects are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most crucial question remains: how are the synaptic weights that lead to a correct response to the input signal determined? The process of setting synaptic weights is again linked with the concept of learning - adaptation - of neural networks. Another issue is the ability to *generalize* - to abstract - from the learned material, in other words, how the neural network is capable of reasoning about phenomena that were not part of the learning process but can somehow be deduced. Here too, there is a sort of analogy with human learning, highlighted by the difference between rote memorization and learning associated with the ability to understand the issues so that new insights can be derived from the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is necessary for teaching a neural network? It includes, first, a so-called *training set* containing elements that describe the problem at hand, and then a method that can fix these samples in the neural network in the form of synaptic weight values, including the aforementioned ability to generalize. Let us first stop at the training set. Each pattern of the training set describes how the neurons of the input and output layers are excited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we can define the training set $T$ as a set of elements (patterns), which are defined as ordered pairs in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set \\( T \\) is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T = \\{ (I_1, O_1), (I_2, O_2), \\ldots, (I_p, O_p) \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each $I_i$ and $O_i$ are vectors representing the excitation of the input and output layers respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_i = [i_{i1}, i_{i2}, \\ldots, i_{in}], \\quad i_{ij} \\in [0,1]\n",

    "- $p$: number of patterns in the training set\n",
    "- $I_i$: vector of excitations of the input layer consisting of $n$ neurons\n",
    "- $O_i$: vector of excitations of the output layer consisting of $m$ neurons\n",
    "- $i_j, o_j$: excitation of the $j$-th neuron of the input and output layer respectively.\n",
